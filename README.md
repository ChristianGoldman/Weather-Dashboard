# 06 Weather-Dashboard #
## My Story ##
* Figured out how to use multiple API's and dynamically change the API URL
* Their is a an API for just about anything someone could need
* I am now comfortable with how local storage works
* Still struggling with parameters and arguments for functions but slowly understanding why they are important
## Features ##
* Search any city in the USA by name and get the current forecast and the next 4 days!
* Any city searched will display in the search history with proper casing (Searched: minneapolis: Displayed: Minneapolis)
* Duplicates will not be displayed into the search history or local storage
* Cities will not be removed from search history upon refresh
* Each city in search history is clickable and displays the forecast
